# Pipeline Kickoff Step #1
#
# This module is used to create a title file with the information needed for a pipeline run
# It is derived from the manually-curated sample manifest
#
# Usage example:
#
# create_title_file_from_manifest \
#   -i ./manifest.xlsx \
#   -o ./DY_title_file.txt
#
# Note: The following requirements will be imposed on the input manifest file:
#
# 1. The fields that are found in the sample manifest should matched with the examples in test/test_data
# 2 The sample ID's in the manifest must be matched somewhere in the fastq file names fom the -d data folder
# 3. The sample ID's in the manifest must be matched somewhere in the path to the SampleSheet.csv files
# 4. The SAMPLE_CLASS column of the manifest must consist of the values either "Tumor" or "Normal"
# 5. Each "Tumor" sample must have at least one associated "Normal" sample
# 6. Each sample folder in the -d data folder must have these three files:
#
# '_R1_001.fastq.gz'
# '_R2_001.fastq.gz'
# 'SampleSheet.csv'


# Todo: Start filling these out in manifest?
# These are normally not found in the manifest, and will be supplied as dashes
MISSING_COLUMNS = [
    'PatientName',
    'MAccession',
    'Extracted_DNA_Yield'
]
